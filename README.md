# Description

Monte Carlo simulations for four experimental settings, where the goal is estimating the average treatment effect.

## Methods
Uses the follow methods to compute an estimate of the average treatment effect:

* Double Machine Learning.
* Propensity Score Matching.
* Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighting.

# Running Experiments

* Use experiments file to create all functions needed in your environment.
* Use run file to run all the experiments.

## Results

* Directory "results" contains .csv files with example output.
* Files contain one hundred average treatment effect estimates for each method, each computed on an independent dataset in the same setting.
