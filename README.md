# Description

Monte Carlo simulations for four experimental settings, where the goal is estimating the average treatment effect.

## Methods
Uses the follow methods to compute an estimate of the average treatment effect:

* Double Machine Learning
* Propensity Score Matching
* Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighting

# Running Experiments

* Use experiments file to create all functions needed in your environment.
* Use run file to run all the experiments.
